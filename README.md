# Smart Irrigation System using ESP32

> **Centre of Innovation in IoT — Silicon Labs Project Challenge Submission**  
> An IoT-based automated irrigation system that monitors soil moisture, temperature, rainfall, and water flow in real-time, and controls a water pump automatically — reducing water wastage and improving crop yield.

---

## 1. Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Water scarcity is one of the most critical challenges facing agriculture today. Traditional irrigation methods rely heavily on manual intervention and fixed schedules, often leading to over-irrigation or under-irrigation — both of which negatively impact crop health and waste precious water resources.

In India alone, agriculture accounts for over 80% of total freshwater consumption. Small and medium-scale farmers lack access to smart, affordable tools that can automate irrigation based on actual soil and environmental conditions.

### Our Solution

The **Smart Irrigation System** is an IoT-based solution built around the **ESP32 microcontroller** that:

- Continuously monitors **soil moisture**, **ambient temperature & humidity**, and **rainfall** conditions
- Automatically activates or deactivates a water pump via a **relay module** based on sensor thresholds
- Measures actual **water flow** to track consumption in real time
- Displays live sensor data on a **16×2 LCD display** for on-site visibility
- Sends **SMS alerts** to the farmer via a **GSM module** when irrigation starts, stops, or anomalies are detected
- Enables **remote monitoring** via Wi-Fi (ESP32 built-in) and a cloud dashboard

### Who It Is For

- Small and medium-scale farmers
- Agricultural research institutions
- Smart greenhouse operators
- Urban rooftop and kitchen garden enthusiasts

### Why It Matters

This project directly addresses **UN Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger)** and **SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation)** by making precision irrigation affordable and accessible using low-cost, widely available components.

## 5. Working Methodology

### Step-by-Step Operation

1. **Initialization**: ESP32 boots up, initializes all sensor pins, LCD display via I2C, GSM module via UART, and connects to Wi-Fi.

2. **Sensor Reading Loop** (every 5 seconds):
   - Reads analog value from soil moisture sensor → converts to % moisture
   - Reads temperature and humidity from DHT11
   - Reads rain sensor (analog + digital threshold)
   - Counts pulses from water flow sensor → calculates L/min

3. **Decision Logic**:
   - If **rain detected** → Pump stays OFF (no irrigation needed)
   - If **soil moisture < threshold (e.g., 40%)** AND no rain → Pump turns ON
   - If **soil moisture > threshold (e.g., 70%)** → Pump turns OFF
   - Thresholds can be adjusted per crop type in firmware

4. **Display**: All readings shown on 16×2 LCD — scrolling between moisture %, temperature, and pump status.

5. **Alerts**: GSM module sends SMS to farmer's registered number:
   - "Irrigation Started – Moisture: 32%, Temp: 28°C"
   - "Irrigation Stopped – Soil is adequately moist"
   - "Rain Detected – Pump deactivated"

6. **Cloud Upload**: ESP32 sends data to ThingSpeak/Blynk every 15 seconds for remote dashboard viewing.

### Irrigation Threshold Table (Configurable)

| Crop Type | Start Irrigation (Moisture %) | Stop Irrigation (Moisture %) |
|-----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Wheat | < 35% | > 65% |
| Rice | < 50% | > 80% |
| Vegetables | < 40% | > 70% |
| Default | < 40% | > 70% |
